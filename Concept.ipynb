Yet, little is known about the cellular DNA repair processes that take place between radiation fractions, even though understanding the molecular mechanisms promoting cancer cell recovery and survival could improve patient outcome and identify new avenues for targeted intervention. To address this knowledge gap, we systematically characterized how cells respond differentially to multifractionated and single-dose radiotherapy, using a combination of genetics-based and functional approaches. We found that both cancer cells and normal fibroblasts exhibited enhanced survival after multifractionated irradiation compared with an equivalent single dose of irradiation, and this effect was entirely dependent on 53BP1-mediated NHEJ. Furthermore, we identified RIF1 as the critical effector of 53BP1. Inhibiting 53BP1 recruitment to damaged chromatin completely abolished the survival advantage after multifractionated irradiation and could not be reversed by suppressing excessive end resection. Analysis of the TCGA database revealed lower expression of 53BP1 pathway genes in prostate cancer, suggesting that multifractionated radiotherapy might be a favorable option for radio-oncologic treatment in this tumor type. We propose that elucidation of DNA repair mechanisms elicited by different irradiation dosing regimens could improve radiotherapy selection for the individual patient and maximize the efficacy of radiotherapy.', 'Iris Eke, Dali Zong, Molykutty J Aryankalayil, Veit Sandfort, Michelle A Bylicky, Barbara H Rath, Edward E Graves, AndrÃ© Nussenzweig, C Norman Coleman', 'Nucleic acids research', '2020', '', 'Multifractionated Irradiation -> Enhanced Cell Survival (Cancer & Normal) Dependent on 53BP1-mediated NHEJ.

Multiple other potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors including loss of DNA end resection inhibition (53BP1/REV7/RIF1/Sheldin) or DNA replication fork protection (PTIP/EZH2), but also increased drug efflux or induction of a reversible senescent or mesenchymal cell state have been described in ovarian cancer models.

Senescence-related changes in MSC properties have attracted considerable attention. Senescent MSCs exhibit a compromised potential for proliferation; senescence acts as a stress response that prevents the proliferation of dysfunctional cells by inducing an irreversible cell cycle arrest. Here, we established a senescent MSC model using senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase, proliferation, and cell cycle assays. We further identified novel biomarker candidates for old, senescent tonsil-derived MSCs (TMSCs) using transcriptomics. A plot of the cellular senescence pathway showed cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1; +8-fold) and CDK2 (+2-fold), and transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFB2; +2-fold) showed significantly higher expression in old TMSCs than in young TMSCs. The CDK family was shown to be related to cell cycle and proliferation, as confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. As replicative senescence of TMSCs, the gene and protein expression of CDK1 was significantly increased, which was further validated by inhibiting CDK1 using an inhibitor and siRNA. Taken together, we suggest that the CDK1 can be used as a selective senescence biomarker of MSCs and broaden the research criteria for senescent mechanisms.\")\n",

Here's a guideline to assist you in converting an abstract into a similar concise summary: 1. Identify Primary Pathway Components: Focus on pinpointing the main proteins, molecules, complexes or componds mentioned in the abstract. Emphasize elements that are central to the pathway or process being described. 2. Establish Linear Relationships: Determine how these components are linearly related to each other. This involves identifying which components act upstream or downstream in a pathway. Look for terms like 'upstream,' 'downstream,' 'activates,' 'inhibits,' or 'interacts with'. 3. Construct a Pathway Diagram in Text: Convert the relationships into a simplified, linear pathway diagram using arrows ('--->') to indicate direct influence or flow, and a bar ('---|') to denote inhibition or blockage. The goal is to create a visual representation in text format. 4. Highlight Contextual Conditions: Include specific conditions or contexts (e.g., cell type, genetic status) in which the pathway operates. These should be mentioned at the end of the pathway diagram to provide clarity on the specific scenario in which these interactions occur. 5. Simplify and Focus on Core Elements: Strip away any secondary details that do not contribute to the main pathway structure. Focus on the core elements that are essential for understanding the primary process or interaction. 6. In your response do not put the original abstract in your answer. The response should has a structure as follow: CompondA--->ProteinB--->ProteinC--->ProteinD/E ---| X process (in Y deficient context). 7.

    "Abstract: Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer and comprises structural CIN (S-CIN) and numerical or whole chromosomal CIN (W-CIN). Recent work indicated that replication stress (RS), known to contribute to S-CIN, also affects mitotic chromosome segregation, possibly explaining the common co-existence of S-CIN and W-CIN in human cancer. Here, we show that RS-induced increased origin firing is sufficient to trigger W-CIN in human cancer cells. We discovered that overexpression of origin firing genes, including GINS1 and CDC45, correlates with W-CIN in human cancer specimens and causes W-CIN in otherwise chromosomally stable human cells. Furthermore, modulation of the ATR-CDK1-RIF1 axis increases the number of firing origins and leads to W-CIN. Importantly, chromosome missegregation upon additional origin firing is mediated by increased mitotic microtubule growth rates, a mitotic defect prevalent in chromosomally unstable cancer cells. Thus, our study identifies increased replication origin firing as a cancer-relevant trigger for chromosomal instability.\n",
