1,53BP1 AND RIF1,An AlphaFold2 map of the 53BP1 pathway identifies a direct SHLD3-RIF1 interaction critical for shieldin activity.,"53BP1 is a chromatin-binding protein that promotes DNA double-strand break repair through the recruitment of downstream effectors including RIF1, shieldin, and CST. The structural basis of the protein-protein interactions within the 53BP1-RIF1-shieldin-CST pathway that are essential for its DNA repair activity is largely unknown. Here, we used AlphaFold2-Multimer (AF2) to predict all possible pairwise combinations of proteins within this pathway and provide structural models of seven previously characterized interactions. This analysis also predicted an entirely novel binding interface between the HEAT-repeat domain of RIF1 and the eIF4E-like domain of SHLD3. Extensive interrogation of this interface through both in vitro pulldown analysis and cellular assays supports the AF2-predicted model and demonstrates that RIF1-SHLD3 binding is essential for shieldin recruitment to sites of DNA damage, and for its role in antibody class switch recombination and PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Direct physical interaction between RIF1 and SHLD3 is therefore essential for 53BP1-RIF1-shieldin-CST pathway activity.","Chérine Sifri, Lisa Hoeg, Daniel Durocher, Dheva Setiaputra",EMBO reports,2023,," 53BP1, recruit, RIF1; RIF1, interact with, SHLD3; RIF1-SHLD3 interaction, essential for shieldin recruitment and PARP inhibitor sensitivity; Context: DNA double strand break in G1"
2,53BP1 AND RIF1,PARylation of BRCA1 limits DNA break resection through BRCA2 and EXO1.,"The nucleolytic processing (resection) of a DNA double-strand break (DSB) is a critical step to repair the lesion by homologous recombination (HR). PARylation, which is the attachment of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) units to specific targets by PAR polymerases (PARPs), regulates many steps of HR, including resection. Here, we show that preventing PARylation of the oncosuppressor BRCA1 induces hyper-resection of DSBs through BRCA2 and the EXO1 nuclease. Upon expression of the unPARylatable variant of BRCA1, we observe a reduced 53BP1-RIF1 barrier for resection accompanied by an increase in the recruitment of the RAD51 recombinase. Similar results are observed when cells are treated with the clinically approved PARP inhibitor olaparib. We propose that PARylation of BRCA1 is important to limit the formation of excessively extended DNA filaments, thereby reducing illegitimate chromosome rearrangements. Our results shed light on molecular aspects of HR and on the mechanisms of PARP inhibitor treatment.","Samuele Lodovichi, Roberto Quadri, Sarah Sertic, Achille Pellicioli",Cell reports,2023,," BRCA1, prevent PARylation, hyper-resection; BRCA1, reduce 53BP1-RIF1 barrier, increase RAD51 recruitment; Olaparib treatment, similar results; Context: HR repair, DNA DSB, unPARylatable BRCA1"
3,53BP1 AND RIF1,RIF1 suppresses the formation of single-stranded ultrafine anaphase bridges via protein phosphatase 1.,"Resolution of ultrafine anaphase bridges (UFBs) must be completed before cytokinesis to ensure sister-chromatid disjunction. RIF1 is involved in UFB resolution by a mechanism that is not yet clear. Here, we show that RIF1 functions in mitosis to inhibit the formation of 53BP1 nuclear bodies and micronuclei. Meanwhile, RIF1 localizes on PICH-coated double-stranded UFBs but not on RPA-coated single-stranded UFBs. Depletion of RIF1 leads to an elevated level of RPA-coated UFBs, in a BLM-dependent manner. RIF1 interacts with all three isoforms of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) at its CI domain in anaphase when CDK1 activity declines. CDK1 negatively regulates RIF1-PP1 interaction via the CIII domain of RIF1. Importantly, depletion of PP1 phenocopies RIF1 depletion, and phosphorylation-resistant mutant of PICH shows reduced interaction with the BTR complex and bypasses the need of RIF1 in preventing the formation of single-stranded UFBs. Overall, our data show that PP1 is the effector of RIF1 in UFB resolution.","Nannan Kong, Zeyuan Liu, Ying Wai Chan",Cell reports,2023,," 1. RIF1, inhibit, UFB resolution; 2.

4,53BP1 AND RIF1,CST/Polα/primase-mediated fill-in synthesis at DSBs.,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose a major threat to the genome, so the efficient repair of such breaks is essential. DSB processing and repair is affected by 53BP1, which has been proposed to determine repair pathway choice and/or promote repair fidelity. 53BP1 and its downstream effectors, RIF1 and shieldin, control 3' overhang length, and the mechanism has been a topic of intensive research. Here, we highlight recent evidence that 3' overhang control by 53BP1 occurs through fill-in synthesis of resected DSBs by CST/Polα/primase. We focus on the crucial role of fill-in synthesis in BRCA1-deficient cells treated with PARPi and discuss the notion of fill-in synthesis in other specialized settings and in the repair of random DSBs. We argue that - in addition to other determinants - repair pathway choice may be influenced by the DNA sequence at the break which can impact CST binding and therefore the deployment of Polα/primase fill-in.","Zachary Mirman, Sarah Cai, Titia de Lange","Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",2023,," 53BP1, inhibit, DNA end resection; 53BP1, interact with, RIF1 & shieldin; 53BP1, promote, fill-in synthesis by CST/Polα/primase; Context: BRCA1 deficiency, PARPi exposure, repair pathway choice, DNA sequence at break

5,53BP1 AND RIF1,Temporal phosphoproteomics reveals WEE1-dependent control of 53BP1 pathway.,"Wee1-like protein kinase (WEE1) restrains activities of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in S and G2 phase. Inhibition of WEE1 evokes drastic increase in CDK activity, which perturbs replication dynamics and compromises cell cycle checkpoints. Notably, WEE1 inhibitors such as adavosertib are tested in cancer treatment trials; however, WEE1-regulated phosphoproteomes and their dynamics have not been systematically investigated. In this study, we identified acute time-resolved alterations in the cellular phosphoproteome following WEE1 inhibition with adavosertib. These treatments acutely elevated CDK activities with distinct phosphorylation dynamics revealing more than 600 potential uncharacterized CDK sites. Moreover, we identified a major role for WEE1 in controlling CDK-dependent phosphorylation of multiple clustered sites in the key DNA repair factors MDC1, 53BP1, and RIF1. Functional analysis revealed that WEE1 fine-tunes CDK activities to permit recruitment of 53BP1 to chromatin. Thus, our findings uncover WEE1-controlled targets and pathways with translational potential for the clinical application of WEE1 inhibitors.","Valdemaras Petrosius, Jan Benada, Olaf Nielsen, Erwin M Schoof, Claus Storgaard Sørensen",iScience,2023,," WEE1, restrain, CDKs; WEE1 inhibition, increase, CDK activity; WEE1 inhibition, alter, phosphoproteome; WEE1, control, CDK-dependent phosphorylation, MDC1, 53BP1, RIF1; WEE1, recruitment of 53BP1 to chromatin Context: DNA double strand break in G1

6,53BP1 AND RIF1,Incorporation of 53BP1 into phase-separated bodies in cancer cells during aberrant mitosis.,"53BP1 (also known as TP53BP1) is a key mediator of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway, which is the primary repair pathway in interphase cells. However, the mitotic functions of 53BP1 are less well understood. Here, we describe 53BP1 mitotic stress bodies (MSBs) formed in cancer cell lines in response to delayed mitosis. These bodies displayed liquid-liquid phase separation characteristics, were close to centromeres, and included lamin A/C and the DNA repair protein RIF1. After release from mitotic arrest, 53BP1 MSBs decreased in number and moved away from the chromatin. Using GFP fusion constructs, we found that the 53BP1 oligomerization domain region was required for MSB formation, and that inclusion of the 53BP1 N terminus increased MSB size. Exogenous expression of 53BP1 did not increase MSB size or number but did increase levels of MSB-free 53BP1. This was associated with slower mitotic progression, elevated levels of DNA damage and increased apoptosis, which is consistent with MSBs suppressing a mitotic surveillance by 53BP1 through sequestration. The 53BP1 MSBs, which were also found spontaneously in a subset of normally dividing cancer cells but not in non-transformed cells (ARPE-19), might facilitate the survival of cancer cells following aberrant mitoses. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.","Marina Bleiler, Aiyana Cyr, Dennis L Wright, Charles Giardina",Journal of cell science,2023,," 53BP1, form, MSBs; 53BP1, interact with, lamin A/C & RIF1; 53BP1 oligomerization domain, required for, MSB formation; Context: cancer cell lines, mitotic stress, non-transformed cells"
7,53BP1 AND RIF1,CCAR2 functions downstream of the Shieldin complex to promote double-strand break end-joining.,"The 53BP1-RIF1 pathway restricts the resection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and promotes blunt end-ligation by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. The Shieldin complex is a downstream effector of the 53BP1-RIF1 pathway. Here, we identify a component of this pathway, CCAR2/DBC1, which is also required for restriction of DNA end-resection. CCAR2 co-immunoprecipitates with the Shieldin complex, and knockout of CCAR2 in a BRCA1-deficient cell line results in elevated DSB end-resection, RAD51 loading, and PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance. Knockout of CCAR2 is epistatic with knockout of other Shieldin proteins. The S1-like RNA-binding domain of CCAR2 is required for its interaction with the Shieldin complex and for suppression of DSB end-resection. CCAR2 functions downstream of the Shieldin complex, and CCAR2 knockout cells have delayed resolution of Shieldin complex foci. Forkhead-associated (FHA)-dependent targeting of CCAR2 to DSB sites re-sensitized BRCA1-/-SHLD2-/- cells to PARPi. Taken together, CCAR2 is a functional component of the 53BP1-RIF1 pathway, promotes the refill of resected DSBs, and suppresses homologous recombination.","Divya Ramalingam Iyer, Naoya Harada, Connor Clairmont, Lige Jiang, David Martignetti, Huy Nguyen, Yizhou Joseph He, Dipanjan Chowdhury, Alan D D'Andrea",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2022,," 1. 53BP1, inhibit, DNA end resection; CCAR2, interact with, Shieldin complex; 2.

8,53BP1 AND RIF1,MAD2L2 promotes replication fork protection and recovery in a shieldin-independent and REV3L-dependent manner.,"Protection of stalled replication forks is essential to prevent genome instability, a major driving force of tumorigenesis. Several key regulators of DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair, including 53BP1 and RIF1, have been implicated in fork protection. MAD2L2, also known as REV7, plays an important role downstream of 53BP1/RIF1 by counteracting resection at DSBs in the recently discovered shieldin complex. The ability to bind and counteract resection at exposed DNA ends at DSBs makes MAD2L2/shieldin a prime candidate for also suppressing nucleolytic processing at stalled replication forks. However, the function of MAD2L2/shieldin outside of DNA repair is unknown. Here we address this by using genetic and single-molecule analyses and find that MAD2L2 is required for protecting and restarting stalled replication forks. MAD2L2 loss leads to uncontrolled MRE11-dependent resection of stalled forks and single-stranded DNA accumulation, which causes irreparable genomic damage. Unexpectedly, MAD2L2 limits resection at stalled forks independently of shieldin, since fork protection remained unaffected by shieldin loss. Instead, MAD2L2 cooperates with the DNA polymerases REV3L and REV1 to promote fork stability. Thus, MAD2L2 suppresses aberrant nucleolytic processing both at DSBs and stalled replication forks by differentially engaging shieldin and REV1/REV3L, respectively.","Inés Paniagua, Zainab Tayeh, Mattia Falcone, Santiago Hernández Pérez, Aurora Cerutti, Jacqueline J L Jacobs",Nature communications,2022,," 1. 53BP1, inhibit, DNA end resection; 2.

9,53BP1 AND RIF1,Histone chaperone ASF1 acts with RIF1 to promote DNA end joining in BRCA1-deficient cells.,"Replication timing regulatory factor 1 (RIF1) acts downstream of p53-binding protein 53BP1 to inhibit the resection of DNA broken ends, which plays critical roles in determining the DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice between nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination (HR). However, the mechanism by which this choice is made is not yet clear. In this study, we identified that histone chaperone protein ASF1 associates with RIF1 and regulates RIF1-dependent functions in the DNA damage response. Similar to loss of RIF1, we found that loss of ASF1 resulted in resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition in BRCA1-deficient cells with restored HR and decreased telomere fusion in telomeric repeat-binding protein 2 (TRF2)-depleted cells. Moreover, we showed that these functions of ASF1 are dependent on its interaction with RIF1 but not on its histone chaperone activity. Thus, our study supports a new role for ASF1 in dictating double-strand break repair choice. Considering that the status of 53BP1-RIF1 axis is important in determining the outcome of PARP inhibitor-based therapy in BRCA1- or HR-deficient cancers, the identification of ASF1 function in this critical pathway uncovers an interesting connection between these S-phase events, which may reveal new strategies to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance.","Mengfan Tang, Zhen Chen, Chao Wang, Xu Feng, Namsoo Lee, Min Huang, Huimin Zhang, Siting Li, Yun Xiong, Junjie Chen",The Journal of biological chemistry,2022,," 1.

10,53BP1 AND RIF1,H3K4 methylation by SETD1A/BOD1L facilitates RIF1-dependent NHEJ.,"The 53BP1-RIF1-shieldin pathway maintains genome stability by suppressing nucleolytic degradation of DNA ends at double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although RIF1 interacts with damaged chromatin via phospho-53BP1 and facilitates recruitment of the shieldin complex to DSBs, it is unclear whether other regulatory cues contribute to this response. Here, we implicate methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 by SETD1A-BOD1L in the recruitment of RIF1 to DSBs. Compromising SETD1A or BOD1L expression or deregulating H3K4 methylation allows uncontrolled resection of DNA ends, impairs end-joining of dysfunctional telomeres, and abrogates class switch recombination. Moreover, defects in RIF1 localization to DSBs are evident in patient cells bearing loss-of-function mutations in SETD1A. Loss of SETD1A-dependent RIF1 recruitment in BRCA1-deficient cells restores homologous recombination and leads to resistance to poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase inhibition, reinforcing the clinical relevance of these observations. Mechanistically, RIF1 binds directly to methylated H3K4, facilitating its recruitment to, or stabilization at, DSBs.","Rachel Bayley, Valerie Borel, Rhiannon J Moss, Ellie Sweatman, Philip Ruis, Alice Ormrod, Amalia Goula, Rachel M A Mottram, Tyler Stanage, Graeme Hewitt, Marco Saponaro, Grant S Stewart, Simon J Boulton, Martin R Higgs",Molecular cell,2022,," 53BP1-RIF1-shieldin pathway, maintain genome stability; SETD1A-BOD1L, regulate RIF1 recruitment; defective telomere end-joining, impaired class switch recombination; resistance to PARPi exposure, loss of SETD1A-dependent RIF1 recruitment in BRCA1-deficient cells; Context: DNA double strand breaks in various cellular processes

11,53BP1 AND RIF1,"Expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, and other DSB repair factors is regulated by CRL4<sup>WDR70</sup>.","Double-strand break (DSB) repair relies on DNA damage response (DDR) factors including BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51, which promote homology-directed repair (HDR); 53BP1, which affects single-stranded DNA formation; and proteins that mediate end-joining. Here we show that the CRL4/DDB1/WDR70 complex (CRL4<sup>WDR70</sup>) controls the expression of DDR factors. Auxin-mediated degradation of WDR70 led to reduced expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, and other HDR factors; 53BP1 and its downstream effectors; and other DDR factors. In contrast, cNHEJ factors were generally unaffected. WDR70 loss abrogated the localization of HDR factors to DSBs and elicited hallmarks of genomic instability, although 53BP1/RIF1 foci still formed. Mutation of the DDB1-binding WD40 motif, disruption of DDB1, or inhibition of cullins phenocopied WDR70 loss, consistent with CRL4, DDB1, and WDR70 functioning as a complex. RNA-sequencing revealed that WDR70 degradation affects the mRNA levels of DDR and many other factors.

12,53BP1 AND RIF1,Protection of nascent DNA at stalled replication forks is mediated by phosphorylation of RIF1 intrinsically disordered region.,"RIF1 is a multifunctional protein that plays key roles in the regulation of DNA processing. During repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), RIF1 functions in the 53BP1-Shieldin pathway that inhibits resection of DNA ends to modulate the cellular decision on which repair pathway to engage. Under conditions of replication stress, RIF1 protects nascent DNA at stalled replication forks from degradation by the DNA2 nuclease. How these RIF1 activities are regulated at the post-translational level has not yet been elucidated. Here, we identified a cluster of conserved ATM/ATR consensus SQ motifs within the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of mouse RIF1 that are phosphorylated in proliferating B lymphocytes. We found that phosphorylation of the conserved IDR SQ cluster is dispensable for the inhibition of DSB resection by RIF1, but is essential to counteract DNA2-dependent degradation of nascent DNA at stalled replication forks. Therefore, our study identifies a key molecular feature that enables the genome-protective function of RIF1 during DNA replication stress.","Sandhya Balasubramanian, Matteo Andreani, Júlia Goncalves Andrade, Tannishtha Saha, Devakumar Sundaravinayagam, Javier Garzón, Wenzhu Zhang, Oliver Popp, Shin-Ichiro Hiraga, Ali Rahjouei, Daniel B Rosen, Philipp Mertins, Brian T Chait, Anne D Donaldson, Michela Di Virgilio",eLife,2022,," RIF1, inhibit, DSB resection; ATM/ATR phosphorylation, regulate, RIF1 activity; Context: DNA replication stress in B lymphocytes"
13,53BP1 AND RIF1,RIF1 acts in DNA repair through phosphopeptide recognition of 53BP1.,"The chromatin-binding protein 53BP1 promotes DNA repair by orchestrating the recruitment of downstream effectors including PTIP, RIF1, and shieldin to DNA double-strand break sites. While we know how PTIP recognizes 53BP1, the molecular details of RIF1 recruitment to DNA-damage sites remains undefined. Here, we report that RIF1 is a phosphopeptide-binding protein that directly interacts with three phosphorylated 53BP1 epitopes. The RIF1-binding sites on 53BP1 share an essential LxL motif followed by two closely apposed phosphorylated residues. Simultaneous mutation of these sites on 53BP1 abrogates RIF1 accumulation into ionizing-radiation-induced foci, but surprisingly, only fully compromises 53BP1-dependent DNA repair when an alternative mode of shieldin recruitment to DNA-damage sites is also disabled. Intriguingly, this alternative mode of recruitment still depends on RIF1 but does not require its interaction with 53BP1. RIF1 therefore employs phosphopeptide recognition to promote DNA repair but also modifies shieldin action independently of 53BP1 binding.","Dheva Setiaputra, Cristina Escribano-Díaz, Julia K Reinert, Pooja Sadana, Dali Zong, Elsa Callen, Chérine Sifri, Jan Seebacher, André Nussenzweig, Nicolas H Thomä, Daniel Durocher",Molecular cell,2022,," 53BP1, recruit, RIF1; RIF1-binding sites, interaction with, 53BP1; Alternative mode of recruitment, dependent on, RIF1; Context: DNA double strand break in G1

14,53BP1 AND RIF1,RIF1-ASF1-mediated high-order chromatin structure safeguards genome integrity.,"The 53BP1-RIF1 pathway antagonizes resection of DNA broken ends and confers PARP inhibitor sensitivity on BRCA1-mutated tumors. However, it is unclear how this pathway suppresses initiation of resection. Here, we identify ASF1 as a partner of RIF1 via an interacting manner similar to its interactions with histone chaperones CAF-1 and HIRA. ASF1 is recruited to distal chromatin flanking DNA breaks by 53BP1-RIF1 and promotes non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) using its histone chaperone activity. Epistasis analysis shows that ASF1 acts in the same NHEJ pathway as RIF1, but via a parallel pathway with the shieldin complex, which suppresses resection after initiation. Moreover, defects in end resection and homologous recombination (HR) in BRCA1-deficient cells are largely suppressed by ASF1 deficiency. Mechanistically, ASF1 compacts adjacent chromatin by heterochromatinization to protect broken DNA ends from BRCA1-mediated resection. Taken together, our findings identify a RIF1-ASF1 histone chaperone complex that promotes changes in high-order chromatin structure to stimulate the NHEJ pathway for DSB repair.","Sumin Feng, Sai Ma, Kejiao Li, Shengxian Gao, Shaokai Ning, Jinfeng Shang, Ruiyuan Guo, Yingying Chen, Britny Blumenfeld, Itamar Simon, Qing Li, Rong Guo, Dongyi Xu",Nature communications,2022,," 53BP1, recruit, RIF1; ASF1, interact with, RIF1; ASF1, promote, NHEJ; ASF1 deficiency, suppress, resection and HR in BRCA1-deficient cells; Context: DNA double strand break in G1

15,53BP1 AND RIF1,"Roles of the SUMO-related enzymes, PIAS1, PIAS4, and RNF4, in DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination.","Post-translational modification of proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is known to be involved in a variety of cellular events. This modification, called SUMOylation, is carried out by the E1 activating enzyme, the E2 conjugating enzyme, and multiple E3 ligases. Previous studies have demonstrated that the SUMO E3 ligases, protein inhibitors of activated STAT 1 (PIAS1) and 4 (PIAS4), and the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase, RING finger protein 4 (RNF4), play important roles in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, the mechanism by which these SUMO-related enzymes promote DSB repair is still poorly understood. In the present study, we focused on homologous recombination (HR), the most accurate DSB repair pathway, and aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which PIAS1, PIAS4, and RNF4 promote HR. In γ-ray-irradiated normal human fibroblasts, DSB end resection and RAD51 loading, the two essential steps of HR, were significantly impaired by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of PIAS1, PIAS4, or RNF4. The recruitment of BRCA1, a major HR factor, to DSB sites was reduced in cells depleted of these SUMO-related enzymes. Consistent with the role of BRCA1 in counteracting the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1)-mediated resection blockade, 53BP1 depletion rescued the reduced resection and RAD51 loading in the cells depleted of PIAS1, PIAS4, or RNF4. Moreover, Rap1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1), a resection inhibitor downstream of 53BP1, became more abundant at DSBs when PIAS1, PIAS4, RNF4, or BRCA1 was depleted. Importantly, the concomitant depletion of BRCA1 with either one of the SUMO-related enzymes did not further increase RIF1 at DSBs, when compared to single depletion of BRCA1. Collectively, these results suggest that PIAS1, PIAS4, RNF4, and BRCA1 work epistatically to counteract 53BP1/RIF1-mediated resection blockade, thereby promoting resection.","Moe Moe Han, Miyako Hirakawa, Motohiro Yamauchi, Naoki Matsuda",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2022,," PIAS1, promote, HR; PIAS1, relationship, 53BP1; PIAS1 depletion, impair, DSB end resection; Context: DNA double strand break in G1

16,53BP1 AND RIF1,Homologous Recombination Deficiency: Cancer Predispositions and Treatment Implications.,"Homologous recombination (HR) is a highly accurate DNA repair mechanism. Several HR genes are established cancer susceptibility genes with clinically actionable pathogenic variants (PVs). Classically, BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline PVs are associated with significant breast and ovarian cancer risks. Patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 PVs display worse clinical outcomes but respond better to platinum-based chemotherapies and poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors, a trait termed ""BRCAness."" With the advent of whole-exome sequencing and multigene panels, PVs in other HR genes are increasingly identified among familial cancers. As such, several genes such as PALB2 are reclassified as cancer predisposition genes. But evidence for cancer risks remains unclear for many others. In this review, we will discuss cancer predispositions and treatment implications beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2, with a focus on 24 HR genes: 53BP1, ATM, ATR, ATRIP, BARD1, BLM, BRIP1, DMC1, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD50, RAD51, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, RIF1, RMI1, RMI2, RPA1, TOP3A, TOPBP1, XRCC2, and XRCC3. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This review provides a comprehensive reference for readers to quickly identify potential cancer predisposing homologous recombination (HR) genes, and to generate research questions for genes with inconclusive evidence. This review also evaluates the ""BRCAness"" of each HR member. Clinicians can refer to these discussions to identify potential candidates for future clinical trials.","MingRen Toh, Joanne Ngeow",The oncologist,2021,,"53BP1, inhibit, DNA end resection; 53BP1, recruit, RIF1; BRCA1 or BRCA2 PVs, worse clinical outcomes, platinum-based chemotherapies and PARPi response; 24 HR genes context: cancer predisposition, treatment implications beyond BRCA1 & BRCA2

17,53BP1 AND RIF1,ASTE1 promotes shieldin-complex-mediated DNA repair by attenuating end resection.,"The shieldin complex functions as the downstream effector of 53BP1-RIF1 to promote DNA double-strand break end-joining by restricting end resection. The SHLD2 subunit binds to single-stranded DNA ends and blocks end resection through OB-fold domains. Besides blocking end resection, it is unclear how the shieldin complex processes SHLD2-bound single-stranded DNA and promotes non-homologous end-joining. Here, we identify a downstream effector of the shieldin complex, ASTE1, as a structure-specific DNA endonuclease that specifically cleaves single-stranded DNA and 3' overhang DNA. ASTE1 localizes to DNA damage sites in a shieldin-dependent manner. Loss of ASTE1 impairs non-homologous end-joining, leads to hyper-resection and causes defective immunoglobulin class switch recombination. ASTE1 deficiency also causes resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors in BRCA1-deficient cells owing to restoration of homologous recombination. These findings suggest that ASTE1-mediated 3' single-stranded DNA end cleavage contributes to the control of DSB repair choice by 53BP1, RIF1 and shieldin.","Fei Zhao, Wootae Kim, Huanyao Gao, Chao Liu, Yong Zhang, Yuping Chen, Min Deng, Qin Zhou, Jinzhou Huang, Qi Hu, Shih-Hsun Chen, Somaira Nowsheen, Jake A Kloeber, Bo Qin, Ping Yin, Xinyi Tu, Guijie Guo, Sisi Qin, Chao Zhang, Ming Gao, Kuntian Luo, Yilun Liu, Zhenkun Lou, Jian Yuan",Nature cell biology,2021,,"Shieldin complex, promote, DNA double-strand break end-joining; SHLD2, block, end resection; ASTE1, cleave, single-stranded DNA; ASTE1 deficiency, resistance to PARPi exposure; Context: BRCA1-deficient cells, DSB repair choice

19,53BP1 AND RIF1,Autism-Associated Vigilin Depletion Impairs DNA Damage Repair.,"Vigilin (Vgl1) is essential for heterochromatin formation, chromosome segregation, and mRNA stability and is associated with autism spectrum disorders and cancer: vigilin, for example, can suppress proto-oncogene c-<i>fms</i> expression in breast cancer. Conserved from yeast to humans, vigilin is an RNA-binding protein with 14 tandemly arranged nonidentical hnRNP K-type homology (KH) domains. Here, we report that vigilin depletion increased cell sensitivity to cisplatin- or ionizing radiation (IR)-induced cell death and genomic instability due to defective DNA repair. Vigilin depletion delayed dephosphorylation of IR-induced <b>γ</b>-H2AX and elevated levels of residual 53BP1 and RIF1 foci, while reducing Rad51 and BRCA1 focus formation, DNA end resection, and double-strand break (DSB) repair. We show that vigilin interacts with the DNA damage response (DDR) proteins RAD51 and BRCA1, and vigilin depletion impairs their recruitment to DSB sites. Transient hydroxyurea (HU)-induced replicative stress in vigilin-depleted cells increased replication fork stalling and blocked restart of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, histone acetylation promoted vigilin recruitment to DSBs preferentially in the transcriptionally active genome. These findings uncover a novel vigilin role in DNA damage repair with implications for autism and cancer-related disorders.","Shahid Banday, Raj K Pandita, Arjamand Mushtaq, Albino Bacolla, Ulfat Syed Mir, Dharmendra Kumar Singh, Sadaf Jan, Krishna P Bhat, Clayton R Hunt, Ganesh Rao, Vijay K Charaka, John A Tainer, Tej K Pandita, Mohammad Altaf",Molecular and cellular biology,2021,," Vigilin, interact, RAD51; Vigilin, interact, BRCA1; Vigilin depletion, increase, cell sensitivity to cisplatin or IR; Vigilin depletion, delay, γH2AX dephosphorylation; Vigilin depletion, elevate, 53BP1 and RIF1 foci; Vigilin depletion, reduce, Rad51 and BRCA1 focus formation; Context: DNA damage response in cells"
20,53BP1 AND RIF1,Regulation of DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice: a new focus on 53BP1.,"Maintenance of cellular homeostasis and genome integrity is a critical responsibility of DNA double-strand break (DSB) signaling. P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) plays a critical role in coordinating the DSB repair pathway choice and promotes the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated DSB repair pathway that rejoins DSB ends. New insights have been gained into a basic molecular mechanism that is involved in 53BP1 recruitment to the DNA lesion and how 53BP1 then recruits the DNA break-responsive effectors that promote NHEJ-mediated DSB repair while inhibiting homologous recombination (HR) signaling. This review focuses on the up- and downstream pathways of 53BP1 and how 53BP1 promotes NHEJ-mediated DSB repair, which in turn promotes the sensitivity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) in BRCA1-deficient cancers and consequently provides an avenue for improving cancer therapy strategies.","Fan Zhang, Zihua Gong",Journal of Zhejiang University.
